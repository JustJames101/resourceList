### Lesson support exercises
*I didn't assign most of these but I think it makes the most sense to give students opportunities to solidify their knowledge through practice*

##### REPL.it
*A lot of what I was pulling from for the students was from a REPL work list from a different version of the class*

[Invite to REPL.it](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/FkATHZF)
  - Lots of good stuff in here and you can decide to use it as you want
  - Some of the wording in these problems are hard for me to understand and some of them are super dry but with some picking and choosing you can find relevant and decent practice.

[My REPL](https://repl.it/@JustJames)
  - Here is a list of the REPLs I started writing to the students access to so they didn't have to use github. They could just fork and go.
  - There is some work to be done in it but it will up date when I do.

[Galvanize Workshop Github](https://github.com/galvanizejs)
  - This is a great resource filled with tons of exercises with lots of practice
  - All of these deal with linking HTML and CSS and JS but the good problems can be extracted from here and reformatted to just JS problems if need be
  - This will be the most time consuming to sort through and in the near future I want to get the exercises to the students but right now they are just in the ether
