### Projects
  *The API projects listed below were chosen because they don't need keys to access data*

[ComicLesson](https://github.com/ninjames101/comicLesson)
  - There are all sorts of stretches here but this is a great exercise for DOM and jQuery and AJAX because the api has images and text and titles we can dynamically create. We also only have one object we are dealing with. It also deals with params and args. We can add a function to change to comic on reload or even a button to do that as well. A great and fun way to test and show case what you learned.

[Pokemon Api lesson](https://github.com/gSchool/ajax-drill)
  - The read me is kind of bland and will need to be altered but the pokemon api is also a great place to start. This one is a better project top complete for AJAX because you can pick and choose how much data comes back.
  - It is also a great DOM exercise because the api has pictures and title and all that jazz
  - Use this new version of the API http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/

[Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api)
  - The lesson would still need to be made for this one but the reddit api/json is an amazing learning tool. You can get info from any subreddit you want. There are gifs and pictures and the students can be as creative as they want in what they want to do with all the info

[Beer](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2)
  - I mean come on, who doesn't love beer?
  - Again the lesson needs to be created for this one but the possibilities for this kind of project are endless
  - This also can be a great AJAX lesson because the students can get back different data based on their request
  - They can make loops to filter info and even for a stretch pair with a location API


  *Non Api projects*
  
  [Mad Libs](https://github.com/gSchool/madlibs)
    - Great project that you can tweak how you see fit
    - Brings in html css and JS
    - Can be made into jQuery or pure JS
    - Tons of room for stretches
    - Great DOM project

  [Pixel Art](https://github.com/gSchool/pixel-art-maker)
    - This is a super ambitious project to do after the two week course but I think it is a great project
    - There is so much to do and to learn here
    - Everything from DOM to good HTML to basic JS functions that generate the boxes
    - The student can even dive deeper into events
