because### JustJames List of thing and stuff

*This repo should can serve as a resource list while planning lessons for students, deciding project ideas, finding problems to go over in class or assigning students extra practice*

_This Repo should not be used alone as a source of lessons and it is in no way complete_

##### My two cents
  - There is a lot of great material on Learn however there isnt enough practice content
  - To really feel like you know something, you have to use it and do it
  - Learn doesn't facilitate that
  - Creating supplemental exercises that students can do when they want allows them to build confidence so they feel like they are actually learning things
  - The "stretches" also solidify the lessons
  - I also provided solve videos that the students could watch on their own time if they wanted to
  - I provided the solves as well
  - This class goes so fast and there are so many things that are purely conceptual that a lot of students can get down on themselves and get discouraged
  - It was because of this that I did stand up and stand down and nightly survey's
    - Stand down was the last chance I had to frame the lessons properly and gave me the chance to remind them I don't expect them to know all of the things I was teaching or really any of the things I was teaching
    - Instead I just wanted them to wrestle with them enough so that the next time they saw "jQuery" they could at least be like "oh I don't know what that is but I know it is a thing"
  - This class asks a lot and I was fortunate to have really good TA's who were dialed in to the students and helped me identify problems early on
  - I found that breaking them up in groups to solve problems the class was struggling with, became super effective. I would then solve the problem up front with each groups help
    - This helped the students see how everybody else was thinking and I think it helped ease some of that fear of not being good enough
  - I also found that teaching this class with a clear end goal in mind helped a ton
    - This course could easily be two classes
    - I decided to focus on the web dev stuff and not just JS
    - I think in the future I would tackle HTML and CSS earlier
    - HTML and CSS with JS is fun for the students because they get to see the practical application of learning these skills
  - At the end of the day the hardest part about the class is getting the students comfortable with only partially knowing things
    - Getting them there faster will lead to greater success in the future

  - I am also very glad I talked about Learning to Learn and Culture of error as well as fixed mind set v growth mind set
    - Bringing those soft skills into the classroom made it feel more of a community and less of a night class
    - Further I think the talking about above ideals and establishing community early on helped solidify that Galvanize culture
